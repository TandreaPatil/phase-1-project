# Ultimate Brew Selector

The purpose of Ultimate Brew Selector is to take the guess work out of selecting your next drink. Craft beers are extremely delicious, but choosing the right one is the real issue at hand. With the growing demand for better beer and more exotic flavors, there also comes the growing crowd of beer drinkers who are absolutely clueless about exactly what it is that they're drinking (and let's be honest... whether it should taste that way.) Whether you're a seasoned brewery devotee who craves a new go-to, or a perplexed first-timer, reading and actually understanding a brewery menu can be overwhelming. We've found that most people don't care about the backstory, the ingredients, and the whole "sha-bang" behind the brew. All they really care about is that it tastes great. So, we've compiled a list of truly amazing brews! Just use the random generator and ask your bartender for that beer. Uh-oh! Bartender says they've tapped out for the night on that selection? Hit the button again and another delicious brew will appear. Trust us on our suggestions... they all taste like they've been sent straight from the beer gods! Once you've had a sip and decide that you love it, you can click on the "like" button to show that brew some love. It'll automatically be added to the "yummy beer list," where you can keep track of a few of our all-time favorites, and the beers you've enjoyed throughout the night. Before you know it, you'll never have to worry about choosing the right beer again because you'll have compiled this all-star beer list. You'll know exactly what to order when you walk up to that bar! To keep the fun going, continue to use Ultimate Brew Selector to discover new,  delicious brews. Don't forget to share the app with all of your brewery buddies!
